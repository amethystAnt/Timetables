# Timetables #

**This project is in early-early stage of development, probably just a skeleton of an app at this point**

The aim of this project is to build an Android app that can serve Swansea University - College of Science students as a better viewer of their timetables. 
Currently they are offered an option to import their timetables in the iCalendar format to their favourite calendar app, but this has the disadvantage that these calendars cannot filter the sessions the user shouldn't attend. 
This app will try to tackle this by providing a feature where the user can specify certain rules for events to be filtered. Another advantage of this app should be that the sessions will have different colors based on the module they belong to. 
And obviously, this app will alert the user if it detects a lecture/lab session has been canceled.

The reason I am making this repository public is that anyone can track my progress on the development.
I expect to have a stable version before Christmas 2019, but that depends on my coursework and also, I need to eat in order to survive, so I'm still going to devote most of my time programming proprietary apps.
